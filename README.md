This document helps you understand the project in 8 slides.
1. Problems with the [2018 SDG Dashboard](https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/#/) were identified: visual biases and lack of details
2. [The improved dashboard](https://10ay.online.tableau.com/t/carsenwei/views/ImprovedUNSDGDashboard/Dashboard1?iframeSizedToWindow=true&:embed=y&:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=no&:showVizHome=no) answers the same questions as the 2018 dashboard but in a more effective manner
    - How is the world performing overall?
    - What is the past and predicted performance for a specific country?
      - Performance on SDG goals
      - Performance on SDG targets
      - Data quality and prediction accuracy
